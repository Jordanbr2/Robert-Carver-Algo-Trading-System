# Mean Reversion Algo Trading Strategy

## Brief Description / Motivation
This project applied the principles of *Systematic Trading* by Robert Carver to test different rules based on multiple hypotheses through diversified rule-based strategies. Moreover, it uses bootstrapping and average correlation to determine the forecast weights and diversification number—key concepts of the book. At the end, all rules were to form a working strategy with a positive sharp ratio.
